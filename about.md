I'm in my second semester at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm studying Mathematics and Computer Science.
Currently my technical classes are:

  • Calculus III
  
  • CS 173: Discrete Structures
  
  • CS 126: Software Design Studio
  
  
Right now I'm looking for a **technology internship** for **summer 2019**. Feel free to contact me if you have any ideas for a CS project or any internship opportunities!
