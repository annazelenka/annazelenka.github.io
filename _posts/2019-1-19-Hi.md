title: January-May 2018: mobile iOS App
---
In high school, I volunteered with some of the students with severe disabilities. While helping them learn arithmetic, I noticed that some of them had difficulty using iPad apps designed to help them learn arithmetic. I then designed and implemented an iPad app specifically designed to be accessible to these students with limited fine motor skills.
